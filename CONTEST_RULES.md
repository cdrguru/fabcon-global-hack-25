- Entrants must build a new Fabric solution that falls into at least one of the following Hackathon Categories (each a “**Project**”).

### 4.1 Hackathon Categories

#### 4.1.1 Best AI Application Built with Microsoft Fabric

Build a complete solution that uses Fabric's advanced capabilities such as Data Agents, integration with AI Foundry, or Copilot Studio. It could also include building retrieval augmented generation (“**RAG**”) apps with the Eventhouse as your vector store, forecasting, anomaly detection, or custom ML models trained in Fabric. The goal is to show how Fabric’s AI capabilities can be combined to build something intelligent and grounded in real data.

- Fabric Features: Data Agents, Building Custom ML Models, integration with AI Foundry/Copilot Studio.
- Judges are looking for: Innovation, AI integration, demo clarity.

#### 4.1.2 Best Use of Real-Time Intelligence (“RTI”)

Create responsive systems that ingest, monitor, and act on real-time data. A solution here could connect to live data sources such as Event Hubs, Kafka, or CDC-enabled databases through Fabric’s Real-Time Hub. Any good RTI solution would include real-time data processing, real-time analytics, realtime monitoring, real-time alerting, or any other real-time application within Microsoft Fabric. Using RTI as a source of data for your AI application is also a great way to showcase the power of RTI. The focus is on showing how real-time data can be used to make decisions, detect issues, and respond quickly.

- Judges are looking for: Use of Fabric Real-Time Intelligence, real-time data sources integration, Real-time data as AI input, real-time dashboards

#### 4.1.3 Best Use of AI Features within Microsoft Fabric

Showcase full Fabric AI capabilities and how they support automation and insight. A solution might use Copilot to build pipelines or generate visuals from natural language, Data Agents to enable conversational analytics, or AI Functions to summarize, classify, or translate data. AutoML and SynapseML may support model training. The aim is to show how Fabric’s AI features help users work faster, prepare data more easily, and uncover useful insights.

- Judges are looking for: Productivity, cost-effectiveness

#### 4.1.4 Best Analytics Solution with Azure or Fabric Databases

Create an analytics solution that connects to Operational Databases on Azure or on Microsoft Fabric. This could be either by connecting to Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, or Azure PostgreSQL using Mirroring, CDC, pipelines or Dataflows Gen2; or se Microsoft Fabric’s native databases: Fabric SQL Database for relational workloads and Fabric Cosmos DB Database for NoSQL scenarios.

- Judges are looking for: Integration with external data sources on Azure *(e.g.Azure PostGreSQL, Azure CosmosDB)*, using operational databases in Fabric for developer applications.

#### 4.1.5 Best Use of Open Mirroring

Build a complete solution that uses pen Mirroring to replicate external data into Fabric. Showcasing how schema changes and updates are handled automatically. The focus is on simplifying ingestion from any source using open mirroring and making external data ready for analytics and insights.

- Judges are looking for: Data integration with Open Mirroring, demo clarity

Judging will take place in two (2) stages, as described below, with one (1) or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor. The odds of winning are based on the number of eligible entries received.

### 6.1  Stage One

The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Project meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required Fabric technologies featured in the Hackathon.

### 6.2  Stage Two

All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “**Judging Criteria**”) below, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the Judges:

| **Judging Criteria**            | **What Judges are Looking For**                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hackathon Category Alignment    | Does the solution clearly fit one or more of the five official categories?                       |
| Innovation & Impact             | Is the solution original, relevant, and solving a real-world problem that benefits others?       |
| Documentation & Reproducibility | Is the GitHub repo well-documented and easy to follow? Can others replicate the solution?        |
| Video Demonstration             | Does the video clearly show how the solution works, especially its use of Microsoft Fabric + AI? |

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable Prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

### 6.3 Tie Breaking

For each Prize listed below, if two (2) or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two (2) or more Submissions are tied on all applicable Judging Criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.
