## What to Build

Entrants must create a Microsoft Fabric data solution that fits within one of the following categories: 

**1. Best AI Application Built with Microsoft Fabric**

Build a complete solution that uses Fabric's advanced capabilities such as Data Agents, integration with AI Foundry, or Copilot Studio. It could also include building retrieval augmented generation (RAG) apps with the Eventhouse as your vector store, forecasting, anomaly detection, or custom ML models trained in Fabric. The goal is to show how Fabric’s AI capabilities can be combined to build something intelligent and grounded in real data. 

- Fabric Features: Data Agents, Building Custom ML Models, integration with AI Foundry/Copilot Studio
- Judges are looking for: Innovation, AI integration, demo clarity

**2. Best Use of Real-Time Intelligence (RTI)**

Create responsive systems that ingest, monitor, and act on real-time data. A solution here could connect to live data sources such as Event Hubs, Kafka, or CDC-enabled databases through Fabric’s Real-Time Hub. Any good RTI solution would include real-time data processing, real-time analytics, real-time monitoring, real-time alerting, or any other real-time application within Microsoft Fabric. Using RTI as a source of data for your AI application is also a great way to showcase the power of RTI. The focus is on showing how real-time data can be used to make decisions, detect issues, and respond quickly. 

- Fabric Features: Real-Time Intelligence, Eventstreams, Eventhouse, Real
- Judges are looking for: realtime data sources integration, Realtime data as AI input, realtime dashboards

**3. Best Use of AI Features within Microsoft Fabric**

Showcase full Fabric AI capabilities and how they support automation and insight. A solution might use Copilot to build pipelines or generate visuals from natural language, Data Agents to enable conversational analytics, or AI Functions to summarize, classify, or translate data. AutoML and SynapseML may support model training. The aim is to show how Fabric’s AI features help users work faster, prepare data more easily, and uncover useful insights. 

- Fabric Features: Copilot, Data Agents, AI Functions, AI Shortcut Transformation, Stand-alone Copilot
- Judges are looking for: Productivity, cost-effectiveness 

**4. Best Analytics Solution with Azure or Fabric Databases**

Create an analytics solution that connects to Operational Databases on Azure or on Microsoft Fabric. This could be either by connecting o Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, or Azure PostgreSQL using Mirroring, CDC, pipelines or Dataflows Gen2; or se Microsoft Fabric’s native databases: Fabric SQL Database for relational workloads and Fabric Cosmos DB Database for NoSQL scenarios.

- Fabric Features: Mirroring, Fabric SQL Database,Fabric Cosmos DB, GraphQL Endpoint
- Judges are looking for: Integration with external datasources on Azure, Using operational databases in Fabric for developer applications

**5. Best Use of Open Mirroring**

Build a complete solution that uses pen Mirroring to replicate external data into Fabric. Showcasing how schema changes and updates are handled automatically. The focus is on simplifying ingestion from any source using open mirroring and making external data ready for analytics and insights.

- Fabric Features: Open Mirroring
- Judges are looking for: Data integration with Open Mirroring, demo clarity
